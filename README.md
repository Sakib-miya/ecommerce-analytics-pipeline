# ecommerce-analytics-pipeline
Ecommerce Analytics Pipeline is a complete end-to-end data project where I generated a full synthetic ecommerce dataset (100k customers, 2k products, 300k orders, 400k sessions), cleaned it using Python (NumPy &amp; Pandas), built a master dataset, and created a professional analytics dashboard.
